		<p>The premise of this assignment is: <em>A movie has an unconscious</em>. It may have several. It's true that movies typically have likeable or unlikeable characters, a heartwarming or heartbreaking story. But to write this paper, you will have to assume that there's something more, something hidden behind the filmic shadows, something the movie says implicitly rather than explicitly. Your job is to uncover this hidden theme, and use it to argue for the movie's importance.</p>
		<p>You may think that movie reviews can be reduced to &ldquo;thumbs up&rdquo; and &ldquo;thumbs down,&rdquo; but such is not the case. Movie reviews are all about the movie's unconscious. To get you started thinking about this, we will read three reviews of Todd Phillips' film <i>Joker</i>. Each points to different subtexts of the film &mdash; its status as a &ldquo;political&rdquo; movie, its &ldquo;racial iconography,&rdquo; Joaquin Phoenix's performance. They go beyond simply reporting on what happens in the movie and whether it's any good. They look for something bigger, more significant, hidden behind the plot.</p>
		<p>They do this, significantly, by honing in on and describing specific moments from the movie in detail. They don't explain the whole plot. They select moments that confirm what they want to say; they describe what's on the screen in detail; they write about the lighting, the sounds/music, the costume design, the actors' bodies. Then they explain how these carefully-made film design choices refer to something else, the film's unconscious, something an average viewer might not pay attention to.</p>
		<p>The first draft of this assignment is due on 4/24, the second draft is due on 5/1, and <em>the final draft is due on 5/8</em>. This assignment is <em>1250 words</em> and is worth <em>10% of your grade</em>.</p>
