	<section id="assignment">
		<p>Our digital platforms are: Eli Review, Slack, Zoom, and Google Docs. Please download apps, make accounts, etc., in the way you see fit.</p>
		<p>Slack is home base. You must log in to Slack at 11a on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, just like our regular class. We'll group chat about assignments and readings there and then. You are welcome to post at other times during the week, if that's something you want to do. You are also welcome (nay, encouraged) to turn off any form of notifications Slack has turned on by default.</p>
		<p>I looked at Zoom and it's cool, so we will hold video meetings there, if bandwidth permits. You can share audio and video, but you can also just chat in text format. So you can share as much or as little of your body as you prefer, you just have to be logged on when I ask you to be logged on, and participate in one format or other. There is even a &ldquo;whiteboard&rdquo; which is nice.</p>
		<p>Variety is the spice of life, and I'm not very creative. If you think our class should try something new, let me know.</p>
		<h2>Grades</h2>
		<p>Here's what will be impacted by this transition:</p>
		<p><em>Presentations:</em> I initially said these were cancelled, but I'm taking that back. The presentation will now be: &ldquo;Share one interesting thing you learned in the research process.&rdquo; I want us to learn from each other! This can just be a message in the Slack like &ldquo;I learned that bees like to dance&rdquo; &mdash; then we all send the clapping emoji. But if you want to do a more elaborate digital presentation (Prezi or whatever), I will offer extra credit for that.</p>
		<p><em>Participation:</em> I will tell you how to earn &ldquo;full participation&rdquo; each week. My goal here is to give you the least work possible while still making you do something (&ldquo;active learning&rdquo;). The norm will be, as originally suggested, three messages and one response to a classmate per week. I don't think this will be difficult &mdash; &ldquo;what are u looking for on this paper sam?&rdquo; will count. But you doing more than that, obviously, will result in you doing more &ldquo;learning,&rdquo; which is why you're in college and what you should be trying to do in this class.</p>
		<p><em>Attendance:</em> Presence in the Slack at 11a, MWF. Otherwise, the attendance policy remains the same. I am hoping this will also encourage you to develop routines and schedules in the otherwise formless situation we find ourselves in.</p>
