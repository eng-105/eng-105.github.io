	<header>Distance Learning Syllabus Updates</header>
	<section id="assignment">
		<p>In addition to continuing our use of Eli Review and Google Docs, we will begin using <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>. At our regular class time &mdash; 1100-1150am, Monday-Wednesday-Friday &mdash; you will log in to Slack, where we will either hold class in the format of a group chat or move over to Zoom.</p>
		<h2>Alterations in Grading</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><em>Attendance:</em> I will &ldquo;take attendance&rdquo; on Slack, asking you if you are there. Email or message me, as per usual, if you will be unable to &ldquo;make it&rdquo; &mdash; although this seems less likely now.</li>
			<li><em>Participation:</em> After consideration, I have decided to assess participation exactly as before. See my explanation of participation in <a href="syll.html">the syllabus</a>. Do the readings and be prepared to talk about them &mdash; and anything else &mdash; in our text- or video-based virtual class. More participation = better participation grade.</li>
			<li><em>Presentation:</em> This is obviously no longer possible. You will instead message the group a brief description of your final research paper, including anything interesting you learned. More elaborate digital presentations (Prezi, Slides, video, etc.) will be eligible for extra credit points, but are not required.</li>
			<p><em>Your grade will not be impacted by technical difficulties on your end.</em> But you are responsible for letting me know that you are having them.</p>
			<p>I will be returning grades to you via UBLearns. On the left-hand side of the page, click &ldquo;Messages.&rdquo; As you know, I am not a huge fan of UBLearns, but it is the only platform I know of that is FERPA-compliant.</p>
		</ul>
		<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
		<p>Zoom allows you to share your webcam and your microphone. You are not obligated to do so. There is also a text-based chat feature. As long as you participate in some way, you may share as much or as little of yourself as you prefer. You will need to download the free Zoom software.</p>
		<p>Google Docs also has a chat feature. It is possible we may hold class there, occasionally, for &ldquo;in-class writing&rdquo; exercises, so familiarize yourself with this feature, if you haven't already.</p>
		<p>I have been and will be making some <em>minor</em> changes to the schedule. If you have printed or created an offline copy of it, please watch for those.</p>
		<p>There will be a Google folder I will share with you, where I will post documents and &ldquo;lecture notes&rdquo; for you, when the need arises.</p>
		<p><em>Please</em> let me know if you need something extra from me. Teaching online is new for me &mdash; let me know if there's something I can do better for you.</p>
		<p>And finally, perhaps most importantly, it is <em>imperative</em> that you spend time doing the readings and keeping up with the schedule. This has always been important, but it becomes all the more so because your learning is about to become more self-directed.</p>
