	<h1>Assignment Sheet</h1>
</header>
<article>
	<p>For your next assignment, you will design the assignment sheet for
 our course final project. When you’re finished, we will hold a vote to
 decide whose assignment sheet we should use for the final project.</p>
 <h2 id="prewriting">Prewriting</h2>
 <p>Before preparing an assignment sheet, you must ask yourself: What do
 I want my students to get out of this assignment? What writing skills
 do they need to develop further? What sort of writing activity will
 help them develop those skills?</p>
 <p><em>Ideally</em>, you will already have a sense of what you and your
 classmates need to work on; if you’re stuck, you might take a look at
 the learning objectives on our syllabus. Pick one or two, and think of
 an assignment that will help build those skills.</p>
 <h2 id="evaluation-style">Evaluation Style</h2>
 <p>Once you’ve come up with the basic concept for your assignment, you
 will need to decide how it should be evaluated. If your assignment is
 selected by the class, I will follow your evaluative criteria when I
 grade.</p>
 <p>Personally, I like assignment sheets with only a small number of
 relatively open-ended criteria, which I call “Requirements.” Some
 writing instructors prefer to follow an extremely rigid rubric. Some
 grade based on the amount of revision, rather than the quality of the
 final product. How do you think writing should be evaluated, and how
 will you design fair but achievable criteria by which your assignment
 should be assessed?</p>
 <h2 id="writing-the-assignment-sheet">Writing the Assignment Sheet</h2>
 <p><em>After</em> you’ve planned out the above, you’re ready to begin
 writing. As always, you should consider your audience when putting this
 assignment sheet together: what will your classmates need to know in
 order to have a clear-cut conception of what they should do to
 successfully complete the assignment? What background information do
 they need? Will they be familiar with the genre you’re asking them to
 write in? Is there anything they could read/look at as a model example?
 Will they be able to draw on past experiences, or will your assignment
 be completely unfamiliar terrain?</p>
 <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Invent an interesting, achievable writing task, appropriate for
 this classroom</li>
 <li>Set clear-cut expectations for how the assignment should be
 evaluated</li>
 <li>Use the assignment to develop a writing skill you think is
 important</li>
 <li>Include a one-sentence description of the assignment (a “tl;dr”) at
 the end of your assignment sheet. We will use this sentence to cast our
 votes.</li>
 </ul>
 <h2 id="fine-print">Fine Print</h2>
 <p>This assignment is worth <strong>10%</strong> of your final grade.
 The first draft is due <strong>April 18</strong> on Eli Review. There
 will then be a peer review session due on <strong>April 20</strong>.
 The final draft should be submitted on paper on <strong>April
 26</strong>. The final draft should be 750 words.</p>
