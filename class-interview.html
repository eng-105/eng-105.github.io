		<p>Find someone you don't know and ask them the following questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?</li>
			<li>Would you like to be famous? For what?</li>
			<li>Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?</li>
			<li>When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?</li>
			<li>If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want?</li>
			<li>Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now, make a Google doc, which you will share with me. Write a short paragraph about your classmate. This paragraph should have a &ldquo;thesis&rdquo: &mdash; that is, it should articulate one cohesive statement about the person that the information you've learned about them supports.</p>
