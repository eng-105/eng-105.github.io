"Sam" is easier than "Helgeson," and more accurate than "Professor Helgeson" or "Mr. Helgeson." Get used to it.

# Board Question (before any syllabus talk)

What is the function of writing? For student answers, create the following table:

General Purpose		|	Specific Task
------------------------|-----------------------------------
*e.g.*, communication	|	*e.g.*, emailing a professor
persuasion		|	publishing a short story
story-telling		|	asking tech support for help

Then, how do you link these two? **Answer: rhetoric.**

* Audience
* Code
* Medium
* Intention (better than purpose?)
