	<h1>Defining Rhetoric</h1>
</header>
<article>
	<p>For the previous assignment, you deployed the terms
 <strong>genre</strong>, <strong>purpose</strong>, and
 <strong>audience</strong> in order to analyze a digital composition you
 created. These three terms are central to the study of
 <strong>rhetoric</strong>, which, along with writing, is the subject of
 this course.</p>
 <p>For your next assignment, you will write a definition of one key
 rhetorical term. After you have submitted your final drafts, I will
 compile them into a reference document, which will then be available to
 you as a resource as we continue to use these terms for the rest of the
 semester.</p>
 <p>You and the members of your peer group will be defining the same
 term; in consequence, peer review will give you a chance not only to
 offer feedback, but also to examine the task of defining a word from a
 variety of perspectives.</p>
 <h2 id="why-are-we-doing-this">Why Are We Doing This?</h2>
 <p>As you know, we live in a search engine age; “Google it” is sage
 wisdom for the uninformed. But someone, somewhere took the time to
 write all that helpful information out – to think through and compile
 the dictionary and encyclopedia entries, the how-to guides, and the
 Shmoop articles we feel we couldn’t live without.</p>
 <p>Their service enables us to live, and their intellectual labor saves
 us a great deal of thinking. So let’s see what it’s like to do what
 they do for us.</p>
 <h2 id="the-research-process">The Research Process</h2>
 <p>You will, of course, need to read a little bit about the term you’ve
 been assigned before you begin writing your definition. I’ll give you
 some things to read, but I think it would be best if you sought out
 reference materials of your own. Google (or better, DuckDuckGo) is your
 friend, but I would encourage you to make use of the <a
 href="https://library.buffalo.edu/">UB Library Catalogue</a> as you
 search. I also find <a href="http://libgen.rs/">Library Genesis</a> a
 useful resource when I am trying to get a book in a hurry.</p>
 <p>Take notes as you read around, and remember to record where your
 information comes from. Since you will be defining your term <em>in
 your own words</em>, it would be a good idea to read many definitions
 and explanations of it, so that you develop a broad general sense of
 what it means. But if you come across a particularly useful way of
 phrasing something, copy it down as a quotation in your notes.</p>
 <h3 id="plagiarism">Plagiarism</h3>
 <p>This assignment lends itself to “plagiarism,” which means presenting
 someone else’s words or ideas as your own. If you feel you do not fully
 understand how to avoid plagiarism (a common difficulty), please reach
 out to me.</p>
 <h2 id="some-thoughts-on-definitions-genre-and-appearance">Some
 Thoughts on Definitions: Genre and Appearance</h2>
 <p>Reference materials like dictionaries and encyclopedias present
 information in a highly structured way. The most important information,
 along with any key terms, is placed at the beginning.</p>
 <p>In terms of tone and word choice, your definition should be
 relatively formal, but accessible and understandable to an ordinary
 reader.</p>
 <p>Definitions – especially of writing concepts – frequently feature a
 few examples that illustrate the concept in action. These are often
 positioned toward the end of the definition; they may even be sectioned
 off from the rest of the text by a header.</p>
 <p>No concept is set in stone. Longer definitions frequently describe
 any debates or disagreements about the meaning of a term; your
 definition should do the same.</p>
 <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
 <p>Your paper should:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Imitate the tone, diction, and style of a typical definition, such
 as those found in dictionaries, encyclopedias, and other reference
 materials;</li>
 <li>Be highly organized – in particular, featuring the key points
 first;</li>
 <li>Illustrate the concept you are defining in a variety of ways –
 including explicit definitions; accounts of any debates about the
 meaning of the term; analogies to other, more familiar concepts; and a
 few examples of the concept in action;</li>
 <li>Make use of typography to create user-friendliness – this might
 include using section headings, or bold and italic text;</li>
 <li>Include a “Further Reading” section at the end, with one or two
 recommendations for someone to learn more about the concept;</li>
 <li>Include a “Works Cited section, also at the end, which cites the
 sources you used when preparing your definition.</li>
 </ul>
 <h2 id="the-fine-print">The Fine Print</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>First draft is due February 21</li>
 <li>Final draft is due February 28</li>
 <li>The final draft should be at least 1,000 words</li>
