		<blockquote><em>Interviewer:</em> What is Pop Art?<br><em>Andy Warhol:</em> Yes.<br><em>Interviewer:</em> Is Pop Art a satiric comment on American Life?<br><em>Andy Warhol:</em> No.</blockquote>
		<p class="source">&mdash;&ldquo;Pop Art? Is it art? A revealing interview with Andy Warhol.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>With the possible exception of the delightfully demure Andy Warhol, interviewees typically prove themselves to be wonderful resources for learning about how work gets done and what it's like to be a person who works. Artists, writers, actors, celebrities, professors are fascinating to us both because they do some kind of work &mdash; even if that work is just &ldquo;being famous&rdquo; &mdash; that we don't know how to do. Despite that, they are regular old humans, too &mdash; they have a bedtime, they like carrots but not peas, they ride their bike in their off-hours, and so on.</p>
		<p>This assignment asks you to interview a professor (or other professional in your field) to find out about the practices by which they do their work. Since this is a writing class, we are especially interested in what role writing plays in this professional's field. Do they write often? What forms and genres do they write in? What kinds of audiences do they write for? The obvious goal is to find out what kind of work, and especially what kind of writing, you will do as a professional in your chosen field.</p>
		<p>The print versions of interviews take on different forms. Some feature an introduction by the interviewer, followed by a transcript of the interview. Some take the form of an essay, with quotes from the interview included throughout. We'll read  examples of <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/al-pacino-and-robert-deniro-godfathers-of-the-year-2019">the first type</a> and <a href="https://www.tastecooking.com/the-future-is-flavorless/">the second type</a> for class, but I encourage you to read or skim many interviews to get a sense of what they actually look like on the page (or screen). Read some with people you'd actually like to read about! Either of the two formats are fine for this assignment, but I would guess the second will be easier. Other formats accepted if you run it by me first.</p>
		<p>This assignment poses a number of technical challenges. For one, professors are often busy people who guard their time carefully. I encourage you to email them and complete the interview as early in the semester as you can. Additionally, we humans are poor of memory &mdash; you're going to need a good strategy for retaining what your professor says. As soon as they close their mouth, it's gone! If you are a speedy note-taker (or even a decent one), great. Write down everything they say. If this seems difficult, ask your interviewee if they would be comfortable with you making an audio recording of your conversation. There are many great phone apps for this, as I'm sure you know.</p>
		<p>I think it goes without saying: Arrive to your scheduled interview on time, ready to go, familiar with your questions, with pen-and-paper or recording device out. Be respectful and professional. And don't just stick to the script! If your interviewee says something that sparks your interest, ask a follow-up question. Be ready to improvise and think on your feet.</p>
		<p>This assignment is worth <em>10% of your final grade</em>. The final draft will be due <em>Friday, Mar 14 by 11:59pm</em>. You will turn in a <em>1,000 word interview</em> to Eli Review and via email.</p>
		<p>It would be great if you came up with (some of) your own questions &mdash; especially if there's anything particular you find interesting about writing in your field. But below please find attached some ones to get you started. <em>It is not required that you answer all of these. Pick which ones you care most about and ask those first.</em></p>
		<ul>
			<li>How often do you write professionally?</li>
			<li>How would you describe your writing process?</li>
			<li>How do you revise your writing? How many drafts of a piece of writing do you typically have to go through?</li>
			<li>What kinds of readers do you write for?</li>
			<li>How do considerations of audience affect your writing process?</li>
			<li>What kinds of writing do you do? Journal articles? Proposals? Notes for conferences or presentations? What about clerical forms of writing – memos, emails, statements about the curriculum?</li>
			<li>What does &ldquo;doing research&rdquo; look like in your field?</li>
			<li>How does your research process relate to your writing process? Are they separate, or do they influence each other?</li>
