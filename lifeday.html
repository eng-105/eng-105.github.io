		<blockquote>Quotidian: &ldquo;2. Of or occurring every day; daily.&rdquo;; &ldquo;3. Of an everyday character; commonplace, mundane, ordinary.&rdquo;<br></blockquote>
		<p class="source">&mdash;<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i></p>
		<p>This assignment asks you to think about your daily (or “quotidian”) experience in college as an occasion for making something to write about. This “something” could be, but is not limited to: a video, a podcast, a comic strip, a website, a series of photos (like for an Instagram) or videos (like for Tik Tok). You will then write me a 750-word statement explaining why and how you decided to represent your day.</p>
		<p>As the definition from the wonderful <a href="https://research.lib.buffalo.edu/OED"><i>Oxford English Dictionary</i></a> above suggests, our daily experiences can seem “ordinary” and “mundane” or even – I’ll just say it – “boring.” That said, the goal of this assignment is to start thinking about “purpose” and “audience” – two terms which will occupy us a great deal this semester. How can you make your daily life as a college student seem fresh, interesting, funny, or strange? Who would want to learn about your experiences at UB, and for what reasons? How can your chosen medium – be it podcast or painting – help you accomplish these aims?</p>
