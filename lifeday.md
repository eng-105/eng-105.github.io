title: A Day in the Life at UB
---

> Quotidian: "2. Of or occurring every day; daily."; "3. Of an everyday
> character; commonplace, mundane, ordinary."

---*The Oxford English Dictionary*

This assignment asks you to think about your daily (or "quotidian")
experience in college as an occasion for making something to write
about. This "something" could be, but is not limited to: a video, a
podcast, a comic strip, a website, a series of photos (like for an
Instagram) or videos (like for Tik Tok). You will then write me a
750-word statement explaining why and how you decided to represent your
day.

As the definition from the wonderful [*Oxford English
Dictionary*](https://research.lib.buffalo.edu/OED) above suggests, our
daily experiences can seem "ordinary" and "mundane" or even -- I'll just
say it -- "boring." That said, the goal of this assignment is to start
thinking about "purpose" and "audience" -- two terms which will occupy
us a great deal this semester. How can you make your daily life as a
college student seem fresh, interesting, funny, or strange? Who would
want to learn about your experiences at UB, and for what reasons? How
can your chosen medium -- be it podcast or painting -- help you
accomplish these aims?

This assignment is worth *10% of your final grade*. The final draft will
be due *Friday, Feb 14 by 11:59pm*. You will turn in the object you have
made and a *750-word report* on that object by email and on Eli Review.
