title: A Day in the Life at UB
---

For your first assignment, you will produce a digital composition
documenting an average day in your life as a college student. You will
then write a 1,000-word analysis of that documentation.

## The Digital Composition

"Digital composition" is an intentionally vague phrase, because I want
you to select your own medium for this part of the assignment. Please
pick something that works well for you, but here are some general ideas:

-   A vlog, as if for *YouTube*

-   A podcast

-   A website

-   A series of short videos, as if for *TikTok*

Once you've decided on what you want to make, but before you begin
making it, carefully consider the following aspects of your digital
composition:

-   Its **genre** -- what are the typical features of this style of
    composition? What is usually included, and what is left out? What is
    its tone?

-   Its **purpose** -- what do you want your viewer to get out of your
    composition? New information? New attitudes or beliefs? A few
    laughs?

-   Its **audience** -- what kind of person typically interacts with
    your chosen medium and genre? What do they expect from it, and how
    will you make sure your composition doesn't disappoint? How will
    their preexisting attitudes and beliefs shape how they interpret
    your digital composition?

Use these questions to plan and structure your digital composition.
Then, when you're ready, document an average day in your life at UB.

## The Written Analysis

After completing the digital composition, you will write a 1,000-word
analysis of it. Analyzing your own work might sound like a strange
activity, but it is helpful to clarify, in writing, the work and the
choices that you put into your compositions. "To analyze," literally,
means "to undo," "to unravel," or "to unpack." The written analysis,
then, is an opportunity to unpack the thought process behind your
digital composition.

Your analysis should identify the **medium** and **genre** you selected
for your composition. It should identify the typical features of that
medium and genre, and identify ways you implemented those features (or
purposefully did not implement them, or failed to). Your analysis should
also identify your digital composition's **purpose** and **audience**,
explaining how you used those concepts to shape your project.

## The Fine Print

-   The first draft of the digital composition and analysis are due on
    Eli Review by Monday, February 7.

-   The final draft is due on Monday, February 14.

-   To submit the digital composition, please simply include a link to
    it at the beginning of your analysis draft.
