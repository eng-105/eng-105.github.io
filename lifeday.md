title: A Day in the Life at UB
---

> Quotidian: "2. Of or occurring every day; daily."; "3. Of an everyday
> character; commonplace, mundane, ordinary."

---*The Oxford English Dictionary*

As the definition from the wonderful [*Oxford English
Dictionary*](https://research.lib.buffalo.edu/OED) above suggests, our
daily experiences can seem "ordinary" and "mundane" -- we might even say
"boring." However, daily experiences and events, when presented in
certain ways, also have the potential to arrest our interest. The
discrepancy between the boringness and interestingness of everyday life
is perhaps nowhere more visible than on social media, where we voraciously
(and sometimes voyeuristically) observe such everday activities as going
shopping, going to the gym, or going to school.

Your first assignment features two components: a digital media creation
and a piece of writing which will accompany it.

## The digital media component

For this part of the assignment, you will document one single day in your life
at UB using any digital audio or visual tool. Although this assignment is
inspired by the "Day in My Life at [INSERT COLLEGE NAME]" genre of YouTube
videos, you are free to complete this assignment using any contemporary
form or genre of digital communication. A series of TikTok/Instagram
posts or a podcast, for example, would be acceptable.

You have two objectives in completing this digital media component:

* To make the quotidian features of your daily life interesting to the
average viewer.
* To give an account of what daily life is like as a student at UB.

It is not necessary that you make this digital component available via
the public internet; you only be able to share it with myself and your
classmates.

## The writing component

Once you have documented your day as above, you will write a 1,000-word
reflection on your digital creation. 

Your objective in this reflection is not to recap your daily life once
again. Instead, your objective here is to analyze the way you represented
your life in your chosen digital medium. You might answer the following
questions:[^questions]

* How did you make daily life as a college student seem fresh, 
interesting, funny, or strange? 
* Who might be the target audience of your digital creation?
* What genre is your creation? How did the genre shape how you represented
your life?

[^questions]: On this assignment sheet -- and in fact on any assignment
sheet at college, I provide you with these questions to point you in
the right direction, **not** to give you a list of requirements. You do
not have to answer every question, and you should certainly not answer
them in the same order. Prioritize producing a meaningful, connected piece
of writing.

This assignment is worth **10% of your final grade**. The final draft is
due **Tuesday, Feb 14**. An earlier draft should be submitted to Eli
Review on **Monday, February 7**; you must also submit comment on your
classmates' projects by **Wednesday, February 9**.
