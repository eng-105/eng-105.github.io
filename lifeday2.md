Our syllabus states that at the conclusion of this class, you will 
be able to "compose in varied media (oral, visual, digital, written)," 
based on your awareness of our "constantly evolving information 
environment." You should also have proficiency "evaluating and
analyzing written, visual, digital and oral arguments."

<!--
In plain English, I assume this means something like: "The internet
is everywhere! We can't just teach students how to write old-fashioned
papers! They need to know how to make video content, podcasts, and
blog posts too! Otherwise our curriculum won't be with the times!"
-->

Therefore, for your first assignment, you will be composing *and*
analyzing a digital creation of your own making.
