subject: From research paper to academic journal article

---

<!-- I'd like to assign Sommers, the one about texting affecting writing, and maybe a literary or psychological journal article. Bonus if one of them you have in a paper copy. -->

Early in the research paper module, you should have a lecture on the relationship between the research essay and the academic journal article. This could feature the concept of knowledge production, the idea that all the bells and whistles are preparatory for that larger endeavor, and the idea that though they aren't held to the same standards, all junior "academic" writing is derivative of what adult researchers are up to.
