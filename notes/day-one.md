# House Rules

"Sam" is easier than "Helgeson," and more accurate than "Professor Helgeson" or "Mr. Helgeson." Get used to it.

This is a talking class, which means it's a no technology class. Sorry to digital note-takers.

# Board Question (before any syllabus talk)

What is the function of writing? For student answers, create the following table:

General Purpose		|	Specific Task
------------------------|-----------------------------------
*e.g.*, communication	|	*e.g.*, emailing a professor
persuasion		|	publishing a short story
story-telling		|	asking tech support for help

Then, how do you link these two? **Answer: rhetoric.**

* Audience
* Code
* Medium
* Intention (better than purpose?)

## a note about textbooks

The syllabus will note titles from *Views*, but they are accessible from *They Say I Say*.

## reading

This might even need to be in the syllabus; reading is assessed by participation. This might be unusual if you're accustomed to tests. You will score low on participation if you don't do the reading. 

## Software

A questionnaire on What word processing software they use, and how they organize files?
