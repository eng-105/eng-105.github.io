# WritRhet 2022's reading list

* [*Wikipedia*, "First Year Writing."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-year_composition)
* [Vil√©m Flusser, "Introduction" and "Superscript" from *Does Writing have a Future?*](reading/flusser.pdf)
* [David Roth, "Introducing the *New Yorker* Eurostep."](https://defector.com/introducing-the-new-yorker-eurostep/)
* [Nancy Sommers, "Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced Adult Writers."](reading/sommers.pdf)
* [Roland Barthes, "The Love Letter."](reading/barthes-loveletter.pdf)
* [Margaret Talbot, "Is It Really Too Late to Learn New Skills?"](readings/talbot.pdf)
* [Burroughs *Paris Review* interview](reading/burroughs-interview.pdf)
* Borges "Library of Babel"

That's six readings. There are eleven chapters of *Views*. That's $6 + 11 = 17$ readings.

For the whole semester there are 15 weeks minus spring break. So $14 \ast 2 = 28$ readings.

*Ergo*, $28 - 18 = 10$ additional readings (18 b/c subtract first day).
