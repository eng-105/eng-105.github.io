	<section id="assignment">
		<p>Students in this class who do the following can expect a high participation score:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Speak every class period;</li>
			<li>Respond to other students (not just to me);</li>
			<li>Share thoughts on assigned readings;</li>
			<li>Turn microphone and camera on while doing group work;</li>
			<li>Have their journal, pen/pencil, and reading out for class; and</li>
			<li>Perform any in-class work I ask of you, and email it to me after class.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Why, you might ask, am I asking you to do these things? I ask because
			your primary goal in this class is not to learn established facts,
			but to develop your own ideas and your own way of communicating them
			effectively. Since this is your objective, you needn’t worry about
			the quality or correctness of what you contribute to class discussion –
			the important thing is that you do contribute.
		</p>
		<p>
			The video classroom is not an ideal environment for a discussion-based
			course, but it does offer a number of compensatory tools for engaging.
			If entering the conversation organically is difficult for you, please
			make use of either the hand-raise or chat features; please also respond
			to your classmates in the chat where appropriate.
