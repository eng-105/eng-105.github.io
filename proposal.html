	<h1>Topic Proposal</h1>
</header>
<article>
	<p>Please email me a brief topic proposal for your research essay by
 <strong>Wednesday, March 9</strong>.</p>
 <p>This proposal should tell me:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>What your topic is.</li>
 <li>Why did you pick this topic?</li>
 <li>Your key terms, <em>i.e.</em>, the search terms you are using to
 find research sources.</li>
 <li>Your research question(s). (<strong>Note</strong>: Your research
 question <em>should</em> change over time, as your ideas evolve. But
 it’s good to put your initial question in writing.)</li>
 <li>What “conversation” your research essay will enter. Who talks about
 this issue, and what are their main claims? What are the enduring
 questions or debates that surround your topic?</li>
 <li>What you think your paper will add to the conversation (obviously
 you don’t know yet, but take a guess).</li>
 </ul>
 <p>There is no length or formatting requirement here. However, I will
 send you a brief comment with suggestions for developing a stronger
 topic, so it is in your best interest to write as much as you can, as
 clearly as you can. Since this is a planning activity, it is acceptable
 to ask questions in this proposal, so that we can start trying to
 answer them early. This is not an assessment, it’s an opportunity for
 me to point you in the right direction.</p>
