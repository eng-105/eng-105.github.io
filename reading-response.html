		<p>Your previous assignment, &ldquo;A Day in the Life at UB,&rdquo; asked you to write about something that you made. This assignment asks you to write about something someone else made &mdash; namely, a piece of writing about writing or the university.</p>
		<p>One of the most common and frequent forms of written work in undergraduate (and graduate) courses is the response paper. These allow professors to assess how you understand an assigned reading and allow you to do some preparatory work for, say, a final paper.</p>
		<p>To complete this assignment, select something we've read for class and write about it. If you want to write about something else, run it by me first, but I'd definitely be interested (as long as it's also about writing or the university). Through summary, paraphrase, and direct quotation (see the chapters in your textbook, pp. 19-51), explain what's going on in this piece of writing or part of it. Then weigh in yourself. Disagree with some part of the piece, or add something you feel was left out, or apply the writer's ideas to something else &mdash; be it personal or more broadly social. You must use someone else's writing about writing or the university to produce some new idea of your own.</p>
		<p>This assignment is worth <em>5% of your final grade</em>. The final draft will be due <em>Friday, Feb 28 by 11:45pm</em>. You will turn in a <em>500-word reading reflection</em> on by email and on Eli Review.</p>
