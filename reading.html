		<p>This is a short assignment with a small set of goals. You will need to pick one of the readings we have done this semester and write about it.</p>
		<p>I'm calling the assignment a &ldquo;Reading Reflection&rdquo; but it is essentially just a response paper &mdash; one of the most common forms of writing professors assign to students. Through response papers, professors assess your understanding of readings and discover what interested you about them. They also provide an opportunity for you to start working your ideas out, in anticipation of a final paper. I think it will be productive for your to get some practice writing them.</p>
		<p>Through summary, paraphrase, and direct quotation (see the chapters in your textbook, pp. 19-51), write about one of our readings. Be as specific as possible &mdash; which may require leaving some parts of the reading out. What interested you? What confused you? What is the writer saying? What questions do you have about the reading?</p>
		<p>After you have written what the writer says, add something of your own to it. Do you disagree with the writer, totally or in part? Why? Did they leave something out? What? Have you read something somewhere else that contradicts them? What? Did it change your thinking? How? You don't have to develop a fully-formed argument about the piece &mdash; use this as an opportunity to try to start figuring out what you think about it.</p>
		<p>This assignment is worth <em>5% of your final grade</em>. The final draft will be due <em>Friday, Feb 28 by 11:45pm</em>. You will turn in a <em>500-word reading reflection</em> by email and on Eli Review.</p>
		<ul>These readings would, I think, be especially good choices:
			<li>Vil&eacute;m Flusser: <a href="flusser-writing.pdf">Introduction and &ldquo;Superscript.&rdquo;</a></li>
			<li>Cary Nelson and Stephen Watt, &ldquo;<a href="nelsonwatt-peer.pdf">Peer Reviewing</a>.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>Nancy Sommers, &ldquo;<a href="sommers-revision.pdf">Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced Adult Writers</a>.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>Kenneth Burke, &ldquo;<a href="burke-persuasion.pdf">Persuasion</a>.&rdquo;</li>
			<li>Roland Barthes, &ldquo;<a href="barthes-loveletter.pdf">The Love Letter</a>.&rdquo;</li>
		</ul>
