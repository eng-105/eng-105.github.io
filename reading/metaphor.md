title: Metaphor 

---

(This definition comes from Ross Murfin and Supriya M. Ray's extremely useful book
*The Bedford Glossary of Critical and Literary Terms*.)

**Metaphor**: From the Greek for "to transfer," a figure of speech (more
specifically a trope) that associates two distinct things without using a 
connective word to link the **vehicle** and the **tenor**. Metaphor is distinguished
from simile, another trope that associates two distinct things by using a
connector such as *like* or *as*. To say "That child is a mouse" is to use a
metaphor, whereas to say "That child is *like* a mouse" is to use a simile. In
either case, the mouse is the vehicle, the image being used to represent the
child, which is the tenor, or subject of the figure.

Theorists ranging from the fourth-century B.C. Greek philosopher Aristotle
to the twentieth-century English literary critic I. A. Richards have argued that
metaphors equate the vehicle with the tenor instead of simply comparing the
two. This identification of vehicle and tenor can provide both linguistic punch
and enhanced meaning. For instance, by saying "Last night I plowed through
a book" rather than "Last night I read a book," you convey not only *that* you
read a book but also *how* you read it, for to read a book in the way that
plow rips through earth is surely to read in a relentless, unreflective way.
Note that, in the sentence above, a new metaphor -- "rips through" -- has been
used to explain an old one, demonstrating just how thick (another
metaphor) language is with metaphors.

Metaphors may be classified as *direct* or *implied*. A direct metaphor,
such as "That child is a mouse," expressly identifies both tenor and vehicle.
An implied metaphor, by contrast, specifies only the vehicle, leaving
the tenor to be inferred from the context of the sentence or passage. For
instance, in the sentence "Last night I plowed through a book," the tenor --
the act of reading -- is implied. A mixed metaphor exists when multiple,
very different -- and sometimes incongruous -- vehicles are used to represent
the same tenor. In his essay "Politics and the English Language" (1946), George
Orwell gave as an example of mixed metaphor the sentence 
"The fascist octopus has sung its swan song."

Metaphors may also be classified as *living*, *dead*, or *dormant*. A dead
metaphor, also called a *frozen metaphor*, is a word or phrase that is no
longer recognized as a metaphor because it has become so familiar. A 
*dormant metaphor* is a word or phrase in the process of dying as a metaphor.

Traditionally, metaphor has been viewed as the most significant of the five
principal tropes, the others being *simile*, *metonymy*, *personification*,
and *synecdoche*.

## Further Examples

Common legal metaphors include "black-letter law," calling a long-standing
 constitutional principle a "fixed star," and seeking to "square" judicial
precedents. Victorian poet Matthew Arnold rather obviously
makes the sea a metaphor for religious faith in his poem "Dover
Beach" (1867):

> The Sea of Faith
> 
> Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore.

Modernist poet D. H. Lawrence uses metaphor less obtrusively in his poem
"Cupresses" (1923), in which the tall, thin, blackish-green trees so familiar
in European paintings are metaphorically transformed into "supple, brooding,
softly-swaying pillars of dark flame." In John Updike's novel *Rabbit Run* (1960),
metaphors reveal the anxieties and obsessions of protagonist Henry "Richard"
Angstrom, who thinks of his car as "a sheath for the knife of himself" and of
Chinese food as "Candy. Heaped on a smoking breast of rice." In Carrie Fisher's
*Postcards from the Edge* (1987), the protagonist is told that

> In India they say that the body is the envelope of the spirit, and the
spirit, I guess, is essentially who you are. Well, we live in a city of envelopes.
The thing that's terrific about you is that *you* are a *letter*. I mean, it
only takes a letter to know a letter, and I can see we're really two letter in
a town of envelopes...

In *We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With
Our Families* (1998), an account by journalist Philip Gourevitch of the
1994 Rwandan genocide in which 800,000 minority Tutsis were killed
three months by the Hutu majority, a dispirited American military intell
pence officer tells Gourevitch, "Do you know What genocide is? A cheese
sandwich. Write it down. Genocide is a cheese sandwich." Puzzled, 
Gourevitch asks for an explanation, and the officer replies, referring to the .
apparent lack of international interest in or response to the killings,
"What does anyone care about a cheese sandwich?" Asking Gourevitch whether he has
ever heard of the Genocide Convention, the officer concludes, "That 
convention makes a nice wrapping for a cheese sandwich."

Tom Petty's song title "Love Is a Long, Long Road" (1989) is -
metaphorical, as is the Rolling Stones' "She's So Cold" (1980), in which a 
reference to a bleeding volcano mixes two vehicles (wound and eruption)
spresent one tenor (emotional overflow). Rapper Mos Def used mining
metaphors in the first verse of "Travellin' Man" (1998) to discuss rhyming
comparing the search for the perfect rhyme to coal mining and finding a
diamond.
