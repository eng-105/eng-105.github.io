<article>
	<p>For this assignment, you will write a 1500-word research essay on a topic of your choosing.</p>
 <h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>
 <p>Selecting a topic is, of course, an important first step. I encourage you to pick something you are genuinely interested in, rather than something that sounds like research paper material. Papers I have received on topics such as football, cults, or television shows are always significantly better than papers on the health risks of cell phones, or cybersecurity and the Department of Defense.</p>
 <p>Please do not select topics related to social media, smartphones, mental health, or the causes and treatments of disease.</p>
 <h2 id="the-research-process">The Research Process</h2>
 <p>Research-based writing requires that you perform two tasks that might feel incompatible. First, you must carefully read what others have written about your chosen topic; you should find these other writers in the UB Library. Then, you must invent your own “claim” or “argument” on that topic. That claim will acknowledge and use the ideas of other writers, but will also be different from them. It will be your original contribution to the ongoing “conversation” about your chosen topic.</p>
 <p>After carefully reading and taking notes on eight pieces of writing on your chosen topic, you will be ready to write your paper, which should quote and summarize those eight pieces of writing, citing them correctly in MLA format.</p>
 <h2 id="arguments-and-claims">Arguments and Claims</h2>
 <p>Your original claim should take one of these three forms:</p>
 <ol type="1">
 <li><p>Filling a “gap.” What have the other researchers you are reading and citing failed to pay attention to? What significant aspect of your topic has remained ignored?</p></li>
 <li><p>Shifting the context. How can your topic be understood in new ways? Would a historian have a different persepective than a computer scientist? Or a politician?</p></li>
 <li><p>Refuting a claim. This means disagreeing with another researcher’s argument. If you go this route, you’ll want to have convincing evidence to prove that they are incorrect.</p></li>
 </ol>
 <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
 <p>Your paper should:</p>
 <ul>
 <li><p>Advance an original argument or claim.</p></li>
 <li><p>Explain to the reader why that claim is significant and deserving of attention.</p></li>
 <li><p>Demonstrate your use of the resources and insights our librarian provides us with.</p></li>
 <li><p>Be “cohesive” — even if there are subtopics and tangents, an explanation of how these relate to the main point is provided.</p></li>
 <li><p>Articulate the “conversation” your research is a part of.</p></li>
 <li><p>Cite at least eight sources, correctly, in MLA format. Five of these must be academic.</p></li>
 </ul>
