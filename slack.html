		<p>Our subsitute for in-class participation will occur on Slack. You will participate by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Responding to any questions I ask.</li>
			<li>Logging on and chatting at our normal class time, 11a-1150a.</li>
			<li>Posting three comments or questions to the #general channel per week. This is exactly like raising your hand: you can ask about upcoming assignments, post your thoughts on one of the readings for the week, or whatever. Unlike speech, however, you can Slack links, files, memes, whatever.</li>
			<li>Responding to two of your peers' posts per week.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>My DMs on Slack will always be open, as they say. Email will be fine too. There will be another channel for announcements, reminders, important dates. I am happy to video conference with you, on any platform you prefer, at any time. Just let me know.</p>
