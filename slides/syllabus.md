# Course Summary

## From the UB Curriculum

This course is an introduction to **research**, **writing**, and **rhetorical practices** employed in **academic** and **professional** contexts. The course examines the operation of **genres**, the **audiences** they address, and the **purposes** they serve. The course focuses on the analysis and development of student writing and rhetorical practice. Typical assignments include research essays, digital compositions, and oral presentations.

::: notes

You should learn to pay attention to these kinds of curricular statements; although they are written in a *stiff*, often *unhelpful* prose, you can learn what to expect from a class by reading between the lines.

For example, you'll notice that we will focus on "practices employed in academic and professional contexts." If your high school English experiences included reading literary works like short stories and poems, you might be expecting something similar from this class; however, literary writing is, in 2021, neither "academic" nor "professional," and so you can modify your expectations.

In addition, you'll notice that there's nothing in that description about grammar, sentence mechaincs, or organization. What the course examines instead are "the operation of genres," "the audiences they address," and "the purposes they serve." So write down the three key things you should focus on this semester: genre, audience, and purpose.

# Learning Outcomes: Argumentation, Citation, Revision

## Learning Outcomes: Argumentation

* Develop proficiency in evaluating and analyzing written, visual, digital and oral arguments representative of diverse perspectives and voices.
* Compose persuasive arguments in varied media (oral, visual, digital, written) for diverse audiences that reflect common standards of academic, professional, and civic genres; 

::: notes

In everyday language, an "argument" refers to a conflict between two or more persons that is unpleasant and usually very opinionated. In our class, we will use the word in a *much* different sense.

Being a sophisticated language user means being able to use the same word to mean different things, depending on the context. So by the end of this course, you should develop a way of talking about the argument that you had with your roommate that is different from the argument you articulated in your paper.

If you've ever had to write a paper with a so-called "thesis statement," an "argument," in our sense of the word, is a similar concept.

:::

## Learning Outcomes: Citation

* Find, comprehend, evaluate and document sources in a constantly evolving information environment; 
* Support arguments ethically with credible and relevant sources; 

::: notes

One similarity between arguments in the common sense and arguments in our sense is that they involve more than one person. That's why another important aspect of our class will be finding, evaluating, and citing sources to build arguments.

In an argument with your friend, enemy, frenemy, or family member, you twist each other's words and try to make sure you're right at all costs. You yell and scream and throw dirt at each other. In an academic argument, by contrast, you cite the words of others; you try to understand and fairly represent both what they wrote and what they meant by it. You respectfully agree and disagree with the source materials you cite.

:::

## Learning Outcomes: Revision

* Improve your writing through a productive writing process that includes drafting, giving and receiving peer feedback and significant revision; 
* Vary written genre conventions appropriately for structure, paragraphing, tone and mechanics; and 

::: notes

The final central concept of our class is "revision." You will write at least two drafts of every paper you submit in this class. For each early draft, you will receive feedback from your classmates and from me, to guide you toward a better final draft. I only grade the final drafts.

A writer is a strange person because unlike a musician or a sports player, we rarely see him or her practice. But they are always practicing. Everything you read -- whether its a textbook or a newspaper article -- has been written and rewritten a few times before you see it.

The problem is that in our era of texts and tweets, the habit of extensively revising your work is falling by the wayside. Rather than honing, reconsidering, and reformulating our writing, we try to say as much as we can as fast as we can. But in this class, it's our responsibility to slow down a little. You cannot accept that the first way you write something out is the only way to say it; it's certainly not the best way.

:::

## Key Concepts

* Genre
* Audience
* Purpose
* Argument
* Citation
* Revision

::: notes

**So**: based on that information from the UB curriculum, these six key terms should be your central focus in this course this semester. There are no exams in this class, but if there were, I would ask you to define each of these in your own words. Please write them down and continue thinking about them this semester.

## Required Materials

* *Views: A Rhetoric and Reader for the University at Buffalo*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2021. 3rd edition.
* Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, *They Say / I Say*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2021. 5th edition. 
* Eli Review. Subscribe to this website at <https://elireview.com/> or purchase a subscription card from the UB bookstore. Our course code is **blast791dams**.

::: notes

These are the materials you must purchase. They can be acquired at the UB Bookstore. Has anyone bought them yet?

To be honest, you don't need *Views* unless you prefer a digital to a paper textbook. They both contain the material we will cover this semester. The difference is that *Views* contains helpful examples, additional readings, and a number of resources you might find useful in this class and down the road.

:::

## Required Materials -- continued

* A word processor that is able to produce Microsoft Word document files (these have the extensions .doc and .docx). 
* Software that can open and add highlights to PDF files. 
* A dedicated folder on your computer for this class.

::: notes

These, like the materials on the previous slide, are also required. The difference is that I won't be evaluating you on your possession of these.

*Don't* be one of my students who loses their essay because they wrote it in a web browser and lost their work when the page refreshed. *Don't* leave your essay tab open for days. Save it somewhere and close the tab.

You might want to email me a draft of a paper to see if you're on the right track. Please attach these as a Word document; don't paste the draft into the body of an email -- that's very difficult to read.

Here is a table of your major assignments. This is on the syllabus too. We'll talk more about what each of these is as they come.

For now, pay attention to the fact that Eli Review is 25% of your grade. That's important. Don't ignore Eli Review.

## Course Policies

### Technology Policy

* No phones in class
* Laptops out only on my request

### Attendance

* Absences granted on request
* Two free unexcused absences; grade penalties for anything more

::: notes

The technology and attendance policy are both in place to ensure that our class dynamic makes productive use of your time. Unfortunately, this class will not function successfully if we are not in dialogue with each other. The only way to learn about genre, audience, purpose, argument, and revision is to put them into practice by talking about them, and by talking about things we read together. So I am attempting to reduce the amount of distraction you encounter as much as possible, and to encourage you to come to class.

That said, I would rather you were *really here* than here slumped over in your chair falling asleep. If you're going to come to class and not contribute, I suggest you make up some reason you can't come and email me about it. There's always the risk that I'll start counting those absences against you, but I also might start counting you absent even if you're present if you're not contributing.

Which brings me to...

:::

## Course Policies

### Participation

* Participation is 10% of your final grade
* Full participation will only be granted if you speak every class period
* Most opportunities to speak in class will be about the assigned reading
* While reading, mark passages to bring up in class:
	* Passages you find interesting/surprising
	* Passages you have questions about
	* Passages you agree/disagree with

## Course Policies

### Assignment submissions

* Rough drafts are submitted on Eli Review
* Final drafts should be printed and handed to me on Tuesdays

### Draft Policy

* No paper without at least one early draft and one round of feedback will be accepted. 
* Unrevised papers will be docked two points
* Papers that have not received feedback will be docked two points

::: notes

Since revision is one of our key concepts, you will rewrite each of the four papers in this class at least once, based on feedback you receive from your classmates and from myself. The early versions of each paper should be submitted to Eli Review, where your classmates will be able to comment on them. After you complete a final copy of a paper, you'll hand it in to me in paper format.

If you fail to submit a paper to Eli Review on time, you won't receive feedback; this means you will be unable to revise, which means in turn that you are not learning the art of rewriting. Consequently, any paper that has not gone through the required drafting process will lose points.

It's *imperative*, therefore, that you turn in drafts to Eli Review on time. You'll get better feedback if they're complete, polished drafts, but if there are a few rough edges still, *please* submit anyway.

:::

## Course Policies

### Late Work

* Submit every rough draft to Eli Review on time
* Avoid late penalties on final drafts by asking for an extension *in advance of the due date*.
