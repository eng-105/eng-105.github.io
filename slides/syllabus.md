# Course Summary

## From the UB Curriculum

This course is an introduction to **research**, **writing**, and **rhetorical practices** employed in **academic** and **professional** contexts. The course examines the operation of **genres**, the **audiences** they address, and the **purposes** they serve. The course focuses on the analysis and development of student writing and rhetorical practice. Typical assignments include research essays, digital compositions, and oral presentations.

::: notes

You should learn to pay attention to these kinds of curricular statements; although they are written in a *stiff*, often *unhelpful* prose, you can learn what to expect from a class by reading between the lines.

For example, you'll notice that we will focus on "practices employed in academic and professional contexts." If your high school English experiences included reading literary works like short stories and poems, you might be expecting something similar from this class; however, literary writing is, in 2021, neither "academic" nor "professional," and so you can modify your expectations.

In addition, you'll notice that there's nothing in that description about grammar, sentence mechaincs, or organization. What the course examines instead are "the operation of genres," "the audiences they address," and "the purposes they serve." So write down the three key things you should focus on this semester: genre, audience, and purpose.

# Learning Outcomes: Argumentation, Citation, Revision

## Learning Outcomes: Argumentation

* Develop proficiency in evaluating and analyzing written, visual, digital and oral arguments representative of diverse perspectives and voices.
* Compose persuasive arguments in varied media (oral, visual, digital, written) for diverse audiences that reflect common standards of academic, professional, and civic genres; 

::: notes

In everyday language, an "argument" refers to a conflict between two or more persons that is unpleasant and usually very opinionated. In our class, we will use the word in a *much* different sense.

Being a sophisticated language user means being able to use the same word to mean different things, depending on the context. So by the end of this course, you should develop a way of talking about the argument that you had with your roommate that is different from the argument you articulated in your paper.

If you've ever had to write a paper with a so-called "thesis statement," an "argument," in our sense of the word, is a similar concept.

:::

## Learning Outcomes: Citation

* Find, comprehend, evaluate and document sources in a constantly evolving information environment; 
* Support arguments ethically with credible and relevant sources; 

::: notes

One similarity between arguments in the common sense and arguments in our sense is that they involve more than one person. That's why another important aspect of our class will be finding, evaluating, and citing sources to build arguments.

In an argument with your friend, enemy, frenemy, or family member, you twist each other's words and try to make sure you're right at all costs. You yell and scream and throw dirt at each other. In an academic argument, by contrast, you cite the words of others; you try to understand and fairly represent both what they wrote and what they meant by it. You respectfully agree and disagree with the source materials you cite.

:::

## Learning Outcomes: Revision

* Improve your writing through a productive writing process that includes drafting, giving and receiving peer feedback and significant revision; 
* Vary written genre conventions appropriately for structure, paragraphing, tone and mechanics; and 

::: notes

The final central concept of our class is "revision." You will write at least two drafts of every paper you submit in this class. For each early draft, you will receive feedback from your classmates and from me, to guide you toward a better final draft. I only grade the final drafts.

A writer is a strange person because unlike a musician or a sports player, we rarely see him or her practice. But they are always practicing. Everything you read -- whether its a textbook or a newspaper article -- has been written and rewritten a few times before you see it.

The problem is that in our era of texts and tweets, the habit of extensively revising your work is falling by the wayside. Rather than honing, reconsidering, and reformulating our writing, we try to say as much as we can as fast as we can. But in this class, it's our responsibility to slow down a little. You cannot accept that the first way you write something out is the only way to say it; it's certainly not the best way.

:::

## Key Concepts

* Genre
* Audience
* Purpose
* Argument
* Citation
* Revision

::: notes

**So**: based on that information from the UB curriculum, these six key terms should be your central focus in this course this semester. There are no exams in this class, but if there were, I would ask you to define each of these in your own words. Please write them down and continue thinking about them this semester.

## Required Materials

* *Views: A Rhetoric and Reader for the University at Buffalo*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2021. 3rd edition.
* Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, *They Say / I Say*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2021. 5th edition. 
* Eli Review. Subscribe to this website at <https://elireview.com/> or purchase a subscription card from the UB bookstore. Our course code is **blast791dams**.

::: notes

These are the materials you must purchase. They can be acquired at the UB Bookstore. Has anyone bought them yet?

To be honest, you don't need *Views* unless you prefer a digital to a paper textbook. They both contain the material we will cover this semester. The difference is that *Views* contains helpful examples, additional readings, and a number of resources you might find useful in this class and down the road.

:::

## Required Materials -- continued

* A word processor that is able to produce Microsoft Word document files (these have the extensions .doc and .docx). 
* Software that can open and add highlights to PDF files. 
* A dedicated folder on your computer for this class.

::: notes

These, like the materials on the previous slide, are also required. The difference is that I won't be evaluating you on your possession of these.

*Don't* be one of my students who loses their essay because they wrote it in a web browser and lost their work when the page refreshed. *Don't* leave your essay tab open for days. Save it somewhere and close the tab.

## Course Policies

### Technology Policy

Cell phones must be put away during class. Laptops and tablets should also be put away except when you are explicitly asked to write in class.

### Attendance

Please contact me via email if you will be absent from class. The writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of unexcused absences; since we meet twice a week, this means you may miss class twice this semester, no questions asked. Each additional week of unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter. University-approved absences are excepted. In the case of a university-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate documentation.

### Participation

Your familiarity with the assigned reading is the basis for your participation grade. Do not expect a satisfactory participation grade without reading everything assigned in advance of class and bringing questions and comments about it to our discussion. 

### Assignment submissions

There are three basic assignments in this class: early drafts of papers, final drafts of papers, and peer review comments. Early drafts and peer review comments will be submitted to Eli Review. Final drafts of papers should be printed and handed to me at the beginning of class.

Final drafts should be double-spaced, in 12pt Times New Roman font. When possible, print double-sided.

**A Note about Files**: Word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs are more stable than Eli Review. Always write drafts in your word processor of choice, then copy and paste your work into Eli Review.

<!-- In class: As mentioned above, the dedicated folder is highly important. It will allow you to produce different files for different drafts. It will save you the heartache of losing your work. -->
<!-- Earlier version of same:

**A word on files**: Written work for this course is submitted electronically, using online tools. These tools can and often do crash. I *strongly* suggest that you do all your writing in your word processing software, then copy and paste your text into, for example, Eli Review. When you email me drafts or other pieces of writing, please attach them to the email as a Word document. And save those files somewhere on your computer.

-->

### Draft Policy

No paper without at least one early draft and one round of feedback will be accepted. 

Papers turned in without the entire required drafting, feedback, and revision history will be docked 2 points. For example: a paper earning 14 points will be marked down to 12 points if not accompanied by a draft with comments, or if you have not commented on your classmates' papers.

### Late Work

Please submit every rough draft to Eli Review on time, even if it is incomplete or you are unsatisfied with it. 

You can avoid late penalties on final drafts by asking for an extension *in advance of the due date*. I'm happy to be flexible, but I need to know about it in advance.

### UB Learns Portfolio

Portfolios are part of the UB Curriculum, which seeks to encourage students to bring the various aspects of their university learning experience together. You can access the portfolio through your UB Learns account. For additional help please email <ublearns@buffalo.edu> or <UBcurriculum@buffalo.edu> with subject line "ePortfolio help."

### Academic Dishonesty

Please familiarize yourself with the University's Academic Integrity policy. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as "Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one's own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one's own." The writing program's policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an "F" on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will
result in failure of the course.

### Repeat Policy

Enrollment in a controlled enrollment course (CEC) such as English 105 is restricted by the available student positions, and self-registration for a CEC in any fall or spring semesters is available only to students taking that course for the first time. Repeat enrollment may be difficult or impossible in a fall or spring semester; a student seeking to repeat a CEC should plan to register for and do this in a UB summer session. Open seats available just prior to the start of a fall or spring semester may be released with registration on a first come first served basis. Repeat enrollment is enrollment by a student who previously enrolled in the course at UB or transferred an equivalent course to UB and for which course the student has a grade of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F' or qualified value thereof [e.g., 'A-', 'D+'], or a grade of 'P', 'S', 'U', 'I', 'J', 'N', or 'R'. A student may self-register to repeat a CEC in a fall or spring term only if the student's grade of record for the previous enrollment is 'W', i.e., administrative withdrawal. Students may petition for enrollment in such a designated spring course by the third week of the preceding fall semester, and in a fall course by the third week of the preceding spring semester. Information about the petition process and other facets of UB's Repeat Policy can be accessed here: <https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html>.

### Incomplete Policy

An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all but one of the written assignments.
