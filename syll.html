		<h2>Course Description</h2>
		<p>
			This is a course on rhetoric and writing – two terms whose meanings
			may not be completely transparent. Writing is one component of a broad
			spectrum of “human” communication practices. When humans communicate,
			we assume that there is some purpose behind their communication. Our
			objective in this class is to think about the social purposes of
			human communication, and what makes this communication effectual.
			To that end, I will ask you to write and re-write, in a variety
			of genres, with the end goal of thinking more about: how you write;
			how you improve your writing; how your writing enters into a
			“conversation”; how you can help your classmates make their own
			writing more effectual; and how to better appreciate the writing
			of others. The royal road to all these aims is writing often and
			reading what others write – particularly your classmates. I will
			ask you to read and comment on your peers’ writing, as part of the
			larger social project of writing and communicating better.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p><em>Portfolio:</em>
			<h2>Attendance & Participation</h2>
			<p>The writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of unexcused absences. <em>Each additional week of unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter</em>.  University-approved absences are excepted.  In the case of a University-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate documentation.</p>
			<p><em>Participation is a relationship to the class that goes beyond attendance</em>. Some strategies for participating include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Speaking in class often.</li>
				<li>Doing the readings, taking notes, and preparing questions or comments about them to share in class.</li>
				<li>Arriving on time with a copy of the reading for the day, something to write with, and paper to write on. A notebook dedicated to this class might be helpful. I will be asking you to hand in in-class writing exercises. On Mondays, when we are in the computer lab, please bring your laptop as well. Additional laptops are available in the lab if you do not have one.</li>
				<li>Coming to my office hours, emailing me frequently (even incessantly) about the course.</li>
				<li><em>Responding to your peers during class discussion.</em> This is without doubt the most productive thing you can do for yourself in any class. I appreciate it immensely.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Paper Submissions</h2>
			<p>All papers must be submitted <em>before the due date on Eli Review and via email</em>. I do not accept late work unless you make arrangements with me ahead of time.</p>
			<h2>Technology in the Classroom</h2>
			<p>As your instructor, I reserve the right to ask you to put away phones and laptops at any time. <em>The use of personal technical devices is not permitted when I have asked you to engage with your peers</em>. This includes, for example, during group exercises that do not require the internet, open classroom discussion, and above all during peer presentations. I encourage you to experiment with taking notes by hand.</p>
			<h2>Academic Dishonesty & Plagiarism</h2>
			<p>Please familiarize yourself with the University’s Academic Integrity policy, which can be found at <a href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html">https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html</a>. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as “Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one’s own.” The writing program’s policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an “F” on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will result in failure of the course.</p>

			<h2>Repeat Policy</h2>
			<p>Enrollment in a controlled enrollment course (CEC) is restricted by the available student positions, and self-registration for a CEC in any fall or spring semesters is available only to students taking that course for the first time. Repeat enrollment may be difficult or impossible in a fall or spring semester; a student seeking to repeat a CEC should plan to register for and do this in a UB summer session. Open seats available just prior to the start of a fall or spring semester may be released with registration on a first come first served basis. Repeat enrollment is enrollment by a student who previously enrolled in the course at UB or transferred an equivalent course to UB and for which course the student has a grade of ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘F’ or qualified value thereof [e.g., ‘A-’, ‘D+’], or a grade of ‘P’, ‘S’, ‘U’, ‘I’, ‘J’, ‘N’, or ‘R’. A student may self-register to repeat a CEC in a fall or spring term only if the student’s grade of record for the previous enrollment is ‘W’, i.e., administrative withdrawal. Students may petition for enrollment in such a designated spring course by the third week of the preceding fall semester, and in a fall course by the third week of the preceding spring semester. Information about the petition process and other facets of UB’s Repeat Policy can be accessed here: <a href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html">https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html</a>.</p>
			<h2>Incomplete Policy</h2>
			<p>An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all but one of the written assignments.</p>
