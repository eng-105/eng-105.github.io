		<h3>Some notes about grading and assignments:</h3>
		<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
		<p>The writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of unexcused absences. <em>Each additional week of unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter</em>.  University-approved absences are excepted.  In the case of a University-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate documentation.</p>
		<h2>Academic Dishonesty & Plagiarism</h2>
		<p>Please familiarize yourself with the University’s Academic Integrity policy, which can be found at <a href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html">https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/integrity.html</a>. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as “Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one’s own.” The writing program’s policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an “F” on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will result in failure of the course.</p>

		<h2>The Center for Excellence in Writing (CEW)</h2>
		<p>The Center for Excellence in Writing (CEW) provides individual consultations to support you at any stage of your writing process.  Friendly and relatable CEW consultants help students at their individualized points of need or interest, whether it be devising an approach to an assignment, brainstorming, assistance with the research process, helping you to generate more material, assisting with citation practices, providing feedback on a finished draft, and more. The CEW also can be a great source of ongoing support for students writing outside of their native language.  The CEW’s main center is located in 209 Baldy Hall.  Appointments can be made by dropping in, online at <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/writing.html">buffalo.edu/writing</a>, or by calling 645-5139. Additional tutoring, especially for early stages of a major assignment, will be available in the Academic and Professional Writing Program’s offices.
