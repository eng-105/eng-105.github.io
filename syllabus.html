 <h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
 <h3 id="technology-policy">Technology Policy</h3>
 <p>Cell phones must be put away during class. Laptops and tablets
 should also be put away except when you are explicitly asked to write
 in class.</p>
 <h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
 <p>Please contact me via email if you will be absent from class. The
 writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of
 unexcused absences; since we meet twice a week, this means you may miss
 class twice this semester, no questions asked. Each additional week of
 unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter.
 University-approved absences are excepted. In the case of a
 university-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate
 documentation.</p>
 <h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
 <p>Your familiarity with the assigned reading is the basis for your
 participation grade. Do not expect a satisfactory participation grade
 without reading everything assigned in advance of class and bringing
questions and comments about it to our discussion. You must contribute to
class discussion every time we meet to do well on participation.</p>
 <h3 id="assignment-submissions">Assignment submissions</h3>
 <p>There are three basic assignments in this class: early drafts of
 papers, final drafts of papers, and peer review comments. Early drafts
 and peer review comments will be submitted to Eli Review. Final drafts
 of papers should be printed and handed to me at the beginning of
 class.</p>
 <p>Final drafts should be double-spaced, in 12pt Times New Roman font.
 When possible, print double-sided.</p>
 <p><strong>A Note about Files</strong>: Word processors like Microsoft
 Word and Google Docs are more stable than Eli Review. Always write
 drafts in your word processor of choice, then copy and paste your work
 into Eli Review.</p>
 <!-- In class: As mentioned above, the dedicated folder is highly important. It will allow you to produce different files for different drafts. It will save you the heartache of losing your work. -->
 <!-- Earlier version of same:

 **A word on files**: Written work for this course is submitted electronically, using online tools. These tools can and often do crash. I *strongly* suggest that you do all your writing in your word processing software, then copy and paste your text into, for example, Eli Review. When you email me drafts or other pieces of writing, please attach them to the email as a Word document. And save those files somewhere on your computer.

 -->
 <h3 id="draft-policy">Draft Policy</h3>
 <p>No paper without at least one early draft and one round of feedback
 will be accepted.</p>
 <p>Papers turned in without the entire required drafting, feedback, and
 revision history will be docked 2 points. For example: a paper earning
 14 points will be marked down to 12 points if not accompanied by a
 draft with comments, or if you have not commented on your classmates’
 papers.</p>
 <h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>
 <p>Please submit every rough draft to Eli Review on time, even if it is
 incomplete or you are unsatisfied with it.</p>
 <p>You can avoid late penalties on final drafts by asking for an
 extension <em>in advance of the due date</em>. I’m happy to be
 flexible, but I need to know about it in advance.</p>
 <h3 id="ub-learns-portfolio">UB Learns Portfolio</h3>
 <p>If you are completing this course as part of your UB Curriculum
 requirements, please select an ‘artifact’ from this course that is
 representative of your learning and save it in a safe location with a
 clear title. Your final UB Curriculum requirement, UBC 399: UB
 Curriculum Capstone, will require you to submit these ‘artifacts’ as
 you process and reflect on your achievement and growth through the UB
 Curriculum. Artifacts include homework assignments, exams, research
 papers, projects, lab reports, presentations, and other coursework. For
 more information, see the UB Curriculum Capstone website: <a
 href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html"
 class="uri">https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html</a>.</p>
 <h3 id="academic-dishonesty">Academic Dishonesty</h3>
 <p>Please familiarize yourself with the University’s Academic Integrity
 policy. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with
 plagiarism, which the catalog describes as “Copying or receiving
 material from any source and submitting that material as one’s own,
 without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source
 (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner
 representing the work of another as one’s own.” The writing program’s
 policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an
 “F” on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will
 result in failure of the course.</p>
 <h3 id="repeat-policy">Repeat Policy</h3>
 <p>Enrollment in a controlled enrollment course (CEC) such as English
 105 is restricted by the available student positions, and
 self-registration for a CEC in any fall or spring semesters is
 available only to students taking that course for the first time.
 Repeat enrollment may be difficult or impossible in a fall or spring
 semester; a student seeking to repeat a CEC should plan to register for
 and do this in a UB summer session. Open seats available just prior to
 the start of a fall or spring semester may be released with
 registration on a first come first served basis. Repeat enrollment is
 enrollment by a student who previously enrolled in the course at UB or
 transferred an equivalent course to UB and for which course the student
 has a grade of ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘F’ or qualified value thereof
 [e.g., ‘A-’, ‘D+’], or a grade of ‘P’, ‘S’, ‘U’, ‘I’, ‘J’, ‘N’, or ‘R’.
 A student may self-register to repeat a CEC in a fall or spring term
 only if the student’s grade of record for the previous enrollment is
 ‘W’, i.e., administrative withdrawal. Students may petition for
 enrollment in such a designated spring course by the third week of the
 preceding fall semester, and in a fall course by the third week of the
 preceding spring semester. Information about the petition process and
 other facets of UB’s Repeat Policy can be accessed here: <a
 href="https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html"
 class="uri">https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html</a>.</p>
 <h3 id="incomplete-policy">Incomplete Policy</h3>
 <p>An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1)
 fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed
 all but one of the written assignments.</p>
 <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
 <h3 id="tutoring-in-writing">Tutoring in Writing</h3>
 <p>The Center for Excellence in Writing (CEW) is available to help you
 with your essays through informal one-to-one meetings with a friendly
 writing consultant. The CEW offers in-person appointments (17 Norton),
