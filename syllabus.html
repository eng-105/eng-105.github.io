		<p>Eli Review is a core component of this course.</p></section>
		<section><h2>Participation</h2>
		<p>Participation in this course includes <em>all forms of verbal participation in class</em>, including asking questions or offering suggestions/feedback to your peers and to me.</p>
		<p>More generally, in-class participation is a way of signalling &ndash; to me and especially to your peers &ndash; that you are thoughtfully engaging in our mutual production of ideas.</p>
		<p>Participation also includes engagement in in-class activities and writing assignments, and performances on pop quizzes which I will occasionally administer with regard to the day's readings.</p></section>
		<section><h2>Presentation</h2>
		<p>The presentation is an opportunity for you to hone your oral rhetorical skills.</p></section>
		<section><h1>Paper formatting</h1>
			<p>I expect all papers to be formatted like <a href="paper.pdf">this</a>.</p>
