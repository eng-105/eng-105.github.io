# Course Summary

This course is an introduction to research, writing, and rhetorical practices employed in academic and professional contexts. The course examines the operation of genres, the audiences they address, and the purposes they serve. The course focuses on the analysis and development of student writing and rhetorical practice. <!-- Our assignments include a researched essay, an interview, a rhetorical analysis, and a digital portfolio. -->

# Learning Outcomes

Having completed English 105, you will be able to:

* Compose persuasive arguments in varied media (oral, visual, digital, written) for diverse audiences that reflect common standards of academic, professional, and civic genres; 
* Find, comprehend, evaluate and document sources in a constantly evolving information environment; 
* Support arguments ethically with credible and relevant sources; 
* Improve your writing through a productive writing process that includes drafting, giving and receiving peer feedback and significant revision; 
* Vary written genre conventions appropriately for structure, paragraphing, tone and mechanics; and 
* Develop proficiency in evaluating and analyzing written, visual, digital and oral arguments representative of diverse perspectives and voices.

<!-- Where does this go? Some kind of "best practices" section? Perhaps a different file entirely?

**A word on files**: Written work for this course is submitted electronically, using online tools. These tools can and often do crash. I *strongly* suggest that you do all your writing in your word processing software, then copy and paste your text into, for example, Eli Review. When you email me drafts or other pieces of writing, please attach them to the email as a Word document. And save those files somewhere on your computer.

# Course Policies

## Technology Policy

Cell phones and laptops must be put away during class discussion. 

However, please do bring your laptop or tablet to our Thursday meetings. We will often be writing informally in the Clemens computer lab.

<!-- Drafts and papers submissions policy -->

## Late Work

Please submit every rough draft to Eli Review on time, even if it is incomplete or you are unsatisfied with it. 

You can avoid late penalties on final drafts by asking for an extension *in advance of the due date*. I'm happy to be flexible, but I need to know about it in advance.

## Draft Policy

No paper without at least one prior draft and round of feedback will be accepted. 

Papers turned in without the entire required drafting, feedback, and revision history will be docked 2 points. For example: a paper earning 14 points will be marked down to 12 points if not accompanied by a draft with comments, or if you have not commented on your classmates' papers.

## Attendance

The writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of unexcused absences. Each additional week of unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter. University-approved absences are excepted. In the case of a university-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate documentation.

## UB Learns Portfolio

Portfolios are part of the UB Curriculum, which seeks to encourage students to bring the various aspects of their university learning experience together. You can access the portfolio through your UB Learns account. For additional help please email <ublearns@buffalo.edu> or <UBcurriculum@buffalo.edu> with subject line "ePortfolio help."

## Academic Dishonesty

Please familiarize yourself with the University's Academic Integrity policy. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as "Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one's own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one's own." The writing program's policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an "F" on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will
result in failure of the course.

## Repeat Policy

Enrollment in a controlled enrollment course (CEC) such as English 105 is restricted by the available student positions, and self-registration for a CEC in any fall or spring semesters is available only to students taking that course for the first time. Repeat enrollment may be difficult or impossible in a fall or spring semester; a student seeking to repeat a CEC should plan to register for and do this in a UB summer session. Open seats available just prior to the start of a fall or spring semester may be released with registration on a first come first served basis. Repeat enrollment is enrollment by a student who previously enrolled in the course at UB or transferred an equivalent course to UB and for which course the student has a grade of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F' or qualified value thereof [e.g., 'A-', 'D+'], or a grade of 'P', 'S', 'U', 'I', 'J', 'N', or 'R'. A student may self-register to repeat a CEC in a fall or spring term only if the student's grade of record for the previous enrollment is 'W', i.e., administrative withdrawal. Students may petition for enrollment in such a designated spring course by the third week of the preceding fall semester, and in a fall course by the third week of the preceding spring semester. Information about the petition process and other facets of UB's Repeat Policy can be accessed here: <https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html>.

## Incomplete Policy

An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all but one of the written assignments.
