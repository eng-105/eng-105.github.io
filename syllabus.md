# Course Summary

This course is an introduction to research, writing, and rhetorical
practices employed in academic and professional contexts. The course
examines the operation of genres, the audiences they address, and the
purposes they serve. The course focuses on the analysis and development
of student writing and rhetorical practice. Our assignments include a
researched essay, an interview, a rhetorical analysis, and a digital
portfolio.

# Learning Outcomes

* Compose persuasive arguments in varied media (oral, visual, digital, written) for diverse audiences that reflect common standards of academic, professional, and civic genres; 
* Find, comprehend, evaluate and document sources in a constantly evolving information environment; 
* Support arguments ethically with credible and relevant sources; 
* Improve your writing through a productive writing process that includes drafting, giving and receiving peer feedback and significant revision; 
* Vary written genre conventions appropriately for structure, paragraphing, tone and mechanics; and 
* Develop proficiency in evaluating and analyzing written, visual, digital and oral arguments representative of diverse perspectives and voices.

# Required Materials

* *Views: A Rhetoric and Reader for the University at Buffalo*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2021. 3rd edition.
* Gerald Graff and Cathy Birkenstein, *They Say / I Say*. W. W. Norton & Company, 2021. 5th edition. 
* Eli Review: Eli Review is a website/app where you will review your classmates' writing, receive feedback on your own writing, and develop revision plans based on feedback. It requires a subscription, which can be purchased either on the website itself or through the UB Bookstore. Eli Review is a required part of all ENG 105 classes, and your work on it is worth 25% of your final grade.  This means that developing your skills in giving productive feedback and in revising your own writing are crucial for success in the class. If you have trouble accessing Eli Review for any reason, please let me or the Academic and Professional Writing Program (Clemens 540, 716-645-0399) know as soon as possible.  
* A word processor that is able to produce Microsoft Word document files (these have the extensions .doc and .docx). Google Docs and Microsoft Word are both acceptable, as are any alternatives. 
* Software that can view and annotate PDF files. Adobe Acrobat Reader DC works well.
* A dedicated folder on your computer or in the cloud for this class. By doing this, all of the written work you do this semester will be easily accessible and well-organized.

**A word on files**: Written work for this course is submitted electronically, using online tools. These tools can and often do crash. I *strongly* suggest that you do all your writing in your word processing software, then copy and paste your text into, for example, Eli Review. When you email me drafts or other pieces of writing, please attach them to the email as a Word document. And save those files somewhere on your computer.

## Assignment Notes

**Eli Review:** There will be work due on Eli Review twice weekly. Please check this site often.
 
**Participation:** Your participation grade is based on the number of times you speak per class.
 
**Rhetorical Analysis:** This assignment asks you to examine one of the sample essays in your textbook. You will think through the argument the essay is making, and the strategies the writer deploys to make that argument.

**Interview:** You will interview an instructor or faculty member at UB on their writing practice, then write about what you learned from that experience.

**Research Essay:** Working with one of the wonderful UB library staff members, we will explore how to find, document, and write about how academic researchers produce and share new knowledge about the world.

**Digital Portfolio:** You will use the UB Learns Portfolio to assemble your substantively revised formal assignments, peer feedback, informal writing, and journal entries at the end of the semester. This digital portfolio will require you to design a coherent and visually appealing space to represent your accomplishments this semester, and to write reflectively on your learning. Portfolios are part of the UB Curriculum, which seeks to encourage students to bring the various aspects of their university learning experience together. This work culminates in UBC 399, the Capstone course.

# Course Policies

## Technology Policy

Cell phones and laptops must be put away during class discussion. Apologies to those who prefer electronic note-taking.

However, please do bring your laptop or tablet to our Thursday meetings. We will often be writing informally on those days we are in the computer lab.

## Late Work

For work on Eli Review, you can avoid late penalties simply by submitting on time. If your work isn't of the quality you want it to be, or if you haven't quite hit the word count, submit anyway -- the point of peer review is to help you correct these problems! 

For final drafts, you can avoid late penalties by asking for an extension *in advance of the due date*. I'm happy to be flexible, but I need to know about it in advance.

## Draft Policy

No paper without at least one prior draft and round of feedback will be accepted. 

Papers turned in without the entire required drafting, feedback and revision history will be docked 2
points.  For example, a paper earning 14 points will be marked down to 12 points if not accompanied by a draft with comments, and if your comments cannot be found on a classmate's paper.

## Attendance

The writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of unexcused absences. Each additional week of unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter. University-approved absences are excepted. In the case of a University-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate documentation.

## UB Learns Portfolio

Portfolios are part of the UB Curriculum, which seeks to encourage students to bring the various aspects of their university learning experience together. You should be able to access the portfolio through your UB Learns account. For additional help please email ublearns@buffalo.edu, or email UBcurriculum@buffalo.edu, with subject line "ePortfolio help."

## Academic Dishonesty

Please familiarize yourself with the University's Academic Integrity policy. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as "Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one's own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one's own." The writing program's policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an "F" on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will
result in failure of the course.

## Repeat Policy

Enrollment in a controlled enrollment course (CEC) such as English 105 is restricted by the available student positions, and self-registration for a CEC in any fall or spring semesters is available only to students taking that course for the first time. Repeat enrollment may be difficult or impossible in a fall or spring semester; a student seeking to repeat a CEC should plan to register for and do this in a UB summer session. Open seats available just prior to the start of a fall or spring semester may be released with registration on a first come first served basis. Repeat enrollment is enrollment by a student who previously enrolled in the course at UB or transferred an equivalent course to UB and for which course the student has a grade of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F' or qualified value thereof \[e.g., 'A-', 'D+'\], or a grade of 'P', 'S', 'U', 'I', 'J', 'N', or 'R'. A student may self-register to repeat a CEC in a fall or spring term only if the student's grade of record for the previous enrollment is 'W', i.e., administrative withdrawal. Students may petition for enrollment in such a designated spring course by the third week of the preceding fall semester, and in a fall course by the third week of the preceding spring semester. Information about the petition process and other facets of UB's Repeat Policy can be accessed here: https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html.

## Incomplete Policy

An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all but one of the written assignments.
