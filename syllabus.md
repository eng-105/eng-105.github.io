## Course Policies

### Technology Policy

Cell phones must be put away during class. Laptops and tablets should also be put away except when you are explicitly asked to write in class.

### Attendance

Please contact me via email if you will be absent from class. The writing program attendance policy allows students one week total of unexcused absences; since we meet twice a week, this means you may miss class twice this semester, no questions asked. Each additional week of unexcused absence will reduce your final grade by one full letter. University-approved absences are excepted. In the case of a university-approved absence, please provide me with appropriate documentation.

### Participation

Your familiarity with the assigned reading is the basis for your participation grade. Do not expect a satisfactory participation grade without reading everything assigned in advance of class and bringing questions and comments about it to our discussion. 

### Assignment submissions

There are three basic assignments in this class: early drafts of papers, final drafts of papers, and peer review comments. Early drafts and peer review comments will be submitted to Eli Review. Final drafts of papers should be printed and handed to me at the beginning of class.

Final drafts should be double-spaced, in 12pt Times New Roman font. When possible, print double-sided.

**A Note about Files**: Word processors like Microsoft Word and Google Docs are more stable than Eli Review. Always write drafts in your word processor of choice, then copy and paste your work into Eli Review.

<!-- In class: As mentioned above, the dedicated folder is highly important. It will allow you to produce different files for different drafts. It will save you the heartache of losing your work. -->
<!-- Earlier version of same:

**A word on files**: Written work for this course is submitted electronically, using online tools. These tools can and often do crash. I *strongly* suggest that you do all your writing in your word processing software, then copy and paste your text into, for example, Eli Review. When you email me drafts or other pieces of writing, please attach them to the email as a Word document. And save those files somewhere on your computer.

-->

### Draft Policy

No paper without at least one early draft and one round of feedback will be accepted. 

Papers turned in without the entire required drafting, feedback, and revision history will be docked 2 points. For example: a paper earning 14 points will be marked down to 12 points if not accompanied by a draft with comments, or if you have not commented on your classmates' papers.

### Late Work

Please submit every rough draft to Eli Review on time, even if it is incomplete or you are unsatisfied with it. 

You can avoid late penalties on final drafts by asking for an extension *in advance of the due date*. I'm happy to be flexible, but I need to know about it in advance.

### UB Learns Portfolio

If you are completing this course as part of your UB Curriculum requirements, please select an ‘artifact’ from this course that is representative of your learning and save it in a safe location with a clear title. Your final UB Curriculum requirement, UBC 399: UB Curriculum Capstone, will require you to submit these ‘artifacts’ as you process and reflect on your achievement and growth through the UB Curriculum. Artifacts include homework assignments, exams, research papers, projects, lab reports, presentations, and other coursework. For more information, see the UB Curriculum Capstone website: <https://www.buffalo.edu/ubcurriculum/capstone.html>.

### Academic Dishonesty

Please familiarize yourself with the University's Academic Integrity policy. In a writing course, we are particularly concerned with plagiarism, which the catalog describes as "Copying or receiving material from any source and submitting that material as one's own, without acknowledging and citing the particular debts to the source (quotations, paraphrases, basic ideas), or in any other manner representing the work of another as one's own." The writing program's policy states that the first instance of plagiarism will result in an "F" on that assignment. Any additional instances of plagiarism will
result in failure of the course.

### Repeat Policy

Enrollment in a controlled enrollment course (CEC) such as English 105 is restricted by the available student positions, and self-registration for a CEC in any fall or spring semesters is available only to students taking that course for the first time. Repeat enrollment may be difficult or impossible in a fall or spring semester; a student seeking to repeat a CEC should plan to register for and do this in a UB summer session. Open seats available just prior to the start of a fall or spring semester may be released with registration on a first come first served basis. Repeat enrollment is enrollment by a student who previously enrolled in the course at UB or transferred an equivalent course to UB and for which course the student has a grade of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F' or qualified value thereof [e.g., 'A-', 'D+'], or a grade of 'P', 'S', 'U', 'I', 'J', 'N', or 'R'. A student may self-register to repeat a CEC in a fall or spring term only if the student's grade of record for the previous enrollment is 'W', i.e., administrative withdrawal. Students may petition for enrollment in such a designated spring course by the third week of the preceding fall semester, and in a fall course by the third week of the preceding spring semester. Information about the petition process and other facets of UB's Repeat Policy can be accessed here: <https://catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/repeat.html>.

### Incomplete Policy

An incomplete grade may only be given to students who have (1) fulfilled the attendance requirement for the course and (2) completed all but one of the written assignments.
