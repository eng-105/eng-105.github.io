<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>This is a  course in rhetoric and writing.  To  develop these skills, you will practice writing in different genres for a  variety of readers, supporting arguments with outside research, and developing  your credibility. Overall, the course is meant to provide a set of tools for  you to use in the very wide range of formal and informal writing situations you  will encounter throughout your academic and professional career.  The aim of this course is to help you become  more confident in your ability to respond to situations that require  communication—which is to say, most situations in life. </p>
<p>The  content of this class is your own writing.   You will be writing a lot, often in response to an assigned reading or paper  prompt.  Because it is impossible to be a  good writer without also being a good reader, you will also be reading a lot,  including especially the work of your classmates.  In fact, you will be reading and writing  something for almost every class meeting, before class and sometimes in class.  You will write for situations with high stakes  (such as grades on assignments) and in situations with low stakes (such as  brainstorming exercises).  You will be  asked to write formally and informally, for yourself and for others.  Also, you will offer feedback to others on  their writing, consider their feedback to you, and strategize how you can revise  what you wrote in order to make it more effective.  Just as good performances in sports and art  are the result of practice in response to coaching, instruction, and peer  support, effective writing is the result of revision based on feedback from a  variety of sources.  All of your formal  writing will be revised based on your classmates&rsquo; feedback before you turn it  in for a grade. We will talk about what it means to give good feedback and what  it means to use feedback in a revision plan.   You will also get feedback on your feedback!  </p>
<h1>How This Course Works</h1>
<p>Your work  in this course takes place during class and on your own time and consists of  reading, drafting and revising (not always in that order). All of the steps are  interrelated.  Writing is a process,  rather than a moment in which you need the right answer, and the secret to  becoming a better writer is to write more.   The structure of this course reflects this.</p>
<p>Probably,  this course works a bit differently than other courses in which you receive  information during class, study it outside of class, and then get tested on how  well you understand that information.  By  contrast, this classroom is &ldquo;flipped,&rdquo; which means that you get or produce the  content <em>outside</em> of class time (the  assigned reading and your own writing) and practice that content <em>during</em> class time (in discussion and writing  in class).  If you don&rsquo;t do the assigned  reading and writing, you won&rsquo;t know what is going on, have examples to work from,  or material to practice with before you get graded on it.</p>
<p>Your  success depends on your effort and engagement.   How well you do depends on how well you are able to keep up with the  schedule, follow instructions, manage your time, understand the readings, use  the advice and examples provided to you, and respond with your own best quality  work.  </p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that you must complete all formal assignments in order to pass the class. All formal  written assignments must be submitted in two formats: electronically, via UB Learns,  and on paper.</p>
<h3>More  about grades and assignments</h3>
<p><em>Formal writing assignments</em>:   All formal assignments should be submitted on UB Learns and on paper.  Each formal assignment will come with an  instruction sheet and grading rubric.   The assignment instructions, class discussions, the associated textbook  chapters and feedback from your peers on drafts are all resources you should  draw on to prepare assignments, and will provide me with a basis on which to  grade.  With all these resources, and  with the answers to any additional questions you may have, there should never  be a moment when you do not know what I am looking for in a paper.</p>
<p>All papers  will require some research, some more than others.  Finding credible sources, using them  effectively, and documenting them correctly are all skills that require  practice, and they are points on which you will be graded.  I will help you develop those skills, as will  the librarians.  Your textbook also has  useful advice and models for reference.  </p>
<p>Note that  each formal assignment has at least one draft workshop associated with it,  conducted on Eli Review, during class time or outside of it.  Since feedback and revision are crucial parts  of the writing process, the draft workshops are as important as the final due  dates for the paper.  Therefore, papers  turned in without the required drafting, feedback and revision history, or  papers turned in by students who have not participated in creating that history  with a partner will be docked 10 points, or one full letter grade (i.e., from a  B+ to a C+).   This is on top of your Eli  Review grade suffering for non-participation.   Once again, this is because effective writing is the product of  revision.</p>
<p><em>Annotated Bibliography:</em> In advance of your report on a  topic, you will have an annotated bibliography due.  The annotated bibliography will document your  planned sources and describe their content and how you plan to use them.  Class time and textbook material will prepare  you for this assignment.  Note that the  Annotated Bibliography does not receive separate grades, but that your report  will lose fully 10% off its final grade if this preliminary assignment is not  turned in correct, complete, and on time (see above).</p>
<p><em>Eli Review:  </em>Since  25% of your grade is based on how will you give feedback to other student  writers and how well you process and incorporate feedback from others, a good  portion of our class at the beginning will be devoted to working on giving  productive feedback and to making feasible and effective revision plans.  Each of your comments on your classmates&rsquo;  work should describe, evaluate, and suggest.   We will talk more about what this means, and of course you can ask me or  anyone working in the writing program about it any time.</p>
<p><em>Participation and writing in class</em>:  We will  often write in class, sometimes on Eli Review, but sometimes not.  This writing will be on a variety of topics,  but it will always be related to the reading for the day or the assignment you  are working on. (See &ldquo;How This Course Works.&rdquo;)   Writing in class will often provide a basis  for class discussion.   Some writing in  class will be used to get ideas going for an upcoming assignment.  It will be evaluated for engagement with  course material.  Writing in class that  does not display understanding of the assigned reading will not receive  credit.  If you are having trouble  understanding the reading, please see me immediately.
