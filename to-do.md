# To-Do's

### Assignment Changes
* *Joker* articles must go
  * Sub for movie review?
  * Visual analysis (visual rhetoric?) no longer requirement
* Eliminate reading reflection?
  * Or, alternately, better plan for implementing it (lesson plans here)
* Portfolio assignment
  * Portfolio assignment - better assignment sheet, host of options
  * Figure out portfolio submission
  * (Could *another* revision at the end of the semester be productive? A revision & reflection?)

### Reading Adjustments
* Alter dates for themed readings - i.e. Barthes for V-Day
* Better interviews (for goodness' sake!)
* Cluster-theme readings
* Add readings and **functioning links to readings**

### Syllabus Adjustments
* Update language in syllabus - esp. portfolio verbiage, course outcomes
* Reconfigure percentages
* Fix participation, draft document for best practices on Zoom
* Update info about UBLearns/Eli Review
* Add journal to requirements
  * And journaling language somewhere
* **At the end**, fix pagination for print version
  * Also craft printable copy of full reading list
