# To-Do's

#### Assignment Changes
* [ ] *Joker* articles must go
  * [ ] Sub for movie review?
  * [ ] Visual analysis (visual rhetoric?) no longer requirement
* [ ] Eliminate reading reflection?
  * [ ] Or, alternately, better plan for implementing it (lesson plans here)
* [ ] Portfolio assignment
  * [ ] Portfolio assignment - better assignment sheet, host of options
  * [ ] Figure out portfolio submission
  * [ ] (Could *another* revision at the end of the semester be productive? A revision & reflection?)
* [ ] Research paper: still good; keep annotated bib; perhaps a reformatted genre, though? Or call it differently?
  * [ ] Definitely incorporate the librarian differently

##### :rotating_light: 6 “writing with” assignments, 30% of grade, 2 weeks apiece (draft, repair): day in the life, social media, documentary, readings, presentation, objects :rotating_light:

##### Possibilities
* Multimodal (a la Shipka?)
