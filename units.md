# Units, Readings

> The traditional English course is, by complaint of all, too frequently a hash of strange ingredients. One day one studies punctuation, the next da paragraphing, the next day an essay on jargon, or frying fish cakes.

-- Harold Briggs, 1947(!), qtd. in Shipka 24. Doesn't sound so bad to me.

## Semester Architecture

Four of the so-called "formal" assignments:
* Interview
* Research Paper
* Portfolio
* And one more: this should prioritize either professional/civic participation *or* multimodality

But *informal writing* should take a centerstage position. Here Briggs' random list can be explored. Paragraphing, subordination/coordination, analysis of genres/modes/contexts, whatever else. **Mine the Keep notes here!**

* Annotated bibliography
* Personal reflection
* Email practice
* Maintenance of the journal
* etc.

## Topics

First, a list as Briggs suggests: here I am not prioritizing, subordinating, or working at a particular level (weekly, daily, "major theme," etc.). Just getting it out there.

* Paragraphing
  * Lindemann has a 10-part unit on this, but I wouldn't have them read that.
* Writing contexts - i.e., channels for publication or transmission, and their associated audiences, genres, levels of verity, whatever.
  * They could bring in sample texts, or I could - though how to show them on Zoom.
  * ^ Good point though: the problem is a physicalist one, which internet has obscured - don't be afraid to talk aesthetics though. That's how I evaluate websites (beyond language)
* What is writing today?
  * Flusser, obv
  * Shipka is very differently-written, better for ac
* Academic writing
  * Interview will address this a little
* Audience and purpose
* Purpose of the course
* Deflation of writing course jargon
  * Thesis
  * Topic sentence
  * Topic
  * Breadth
* The modes
* Writing as thinking
  * There was a promising-sounding essay cited by Lindemann on process, I think
