 vegetarians and the different kinds of vegetarians. You will write
 about the pros and cons of each vegetarian. You will find each
 vegetarian and list the many pros and cons of each one. Learning the
 pros and cons of each one allows you to understand the history and the
 reason why people follow these kinds of diets. The benefits of being a
 vegetarian can also influence you as a person to try the diet.</p>
