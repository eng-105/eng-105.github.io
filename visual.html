	<h1>Informal Visual Analysis</h1>
</header>
<article>
	<p>Write a visual analysis of any piece of media that means something
 to you, such as a movie, tv show, <em>YouTube</em> video, video game,
 artwork, or magazine (so long as the magazine features a visual
 component). Within this analysis, treat it informally while keeping in
 mind your audience; remain appropriate (remember we are still being
 graded by Sam). But don’t feel the need to sound like an
 aristocrat!</p>
 <h2 id="choosing-your-media">Choosing Your Media</h2>
 <p>When choosing your piece of media make sure that is has at least
 some emotional significance to you, otherwise you will be stuck BSing a
 1000-word paper. Don’t choose something that you’ve never
 watched/looked at – this assignment will end up being much harder than
 it actually is; just do something that has meaning to you! Don’t feel
 like you must choose one of the options listed above, but keep your
 selection appropriate (if it’s not something you’d show in public it
 probably not something you should write for your English class!)</p>
 <h2 id="specifics">Specifics</h2>
 <p>When writing your piece be creative! Choose a piece of media that
 means something to you, take this meaning and then relate it to one of
 the themes below (see chart). For example: say you chose a movie that
 was meaningful to you because it provided mental support; you can take
 your personal experience and feelings towards that film and relate it
 to the social theme. You could also relate it to the cultural theme and
 talk about the cultural importance your piece of media has to you. Take
 these themes and make them yours. Don’t feel the need to do research
 and create a scholarly thesis. Just remember to keep it informal, don’t
 feel pressured to make this another research paper.</p>

 <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
 <p>Your writing must be at least 1250 words and be in MLA format. The
 only thing that would need to be cited is your piece of media, and any
 other sources you find helpful or necessary to your writing. Keep your
 writing informal, almost like if you were to write the closed
 captioning on a conversation. Obviously keep it appropriate but take
 this as an opportunity to really think about your audience, try and
 relate to them through your writing. Use literary techniques and
 devices such as jargon/colloquialisms, asides, metaphors/hyperboles,
 and figures of speech to address the audience (<strong>Usage of these
 and others will be the basis of grading</strong>).</p>
 <h2 id="refining-your-skills">Refining Your Skills</h2>
 <p>This specific assignment can help you learn how to speak to an
 audience and to persuade them of the importance of your media. It can
 also help you learn to write informally (which is rarely ever taught,
 because of its niche-ness). Informal writing can be used when writing
 personal pieces, or even when writing something like an application
 essay.</p>
 <h2 id="informality-as-an-idea">Informality as an Idea</h2>
 <p>Informality in writing can often be subjective and dynamic, this is
 why the definition for informality within this assignment is similar to
 a spoken conversation; meaning that it may contain (appropriate) slang
 words/figures of speech, metaphors, and asides; however you choose to
 do it, your writing should continuously keep a personal tone. This
 personal tone is going to be the basis of grading. <strong>You must use
 first person pronouns such as you and I</strong>. These words must be
 in your paper at least once, because you are talking about
 <em>your</em> feelings. There is an emphasis on you throughout this
 assignment. It should not feel like a scholarly paper.</p>
 <h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>
 <p>This analysis should still be split into paragraphs to break up the
 reading for the audience, but your introduction and conclusion do not
 need to be that of a research paper. Use the introduction to truly
 introduce your piece of media and talk about the personal connection
 you have with it, and then use your conclusion to possibly talk about
 the future impact and importance of the piece. Once again be creative –
 maybe use this opportunity to talk about the impression the media has
 left on you and if it has inspired you to do something with it.</p>
