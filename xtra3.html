		<p>You are required to share a brief explanation of your research paper to the class the week of April 13. If, however, you would like some extra credit, three extra credit points are available to you if you share a more elaborate digital presentation of your research project. This will be due April 13. If you're planning to take on this extra credit oppotunity, please let me know in advance &mdash; it will affect how I plan class for the week.</p>
		<p>This extra-credit assignment is open-ended. Your presentation could be a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation, a video or audio file, webpage &mdash; whatever you like. I will evaluate it based on perceived effort and how effectively it communicates your research.</p>
